# Purdue Photography Contest
As President of the Purdue Photography Club, I ended up in charge of running our photo contest which we moved online during to the current pandemic. 

## The Problem
We had 179 total photos entered on our website, and we had the data to be self populated into a Google Sheets file. We then had two Google Docs, one for each of our two judges, to record their scores and write down their comments. That is a total 2685 individual data points that we have to copy and verify which is way too much to do manually. Then, we would have to send an email to each individual who entered with their specific scoring reports and judges comments. We could have just shared the Google Sheets file, and let everyone look at their scores. However, that would not be very secure or appropriate way of doing it.

## The Solution
I wrote this code running on Google App Script to do all of that automatically. First, there is a function to read all the raw judging data from the two separate Google Docs. Then, we pass all that data to be inputed into our Google Sheets file while verifying that we are indeed entering it into the correct record. One key optimization is that both the Google Docs and Google Sheets file were sorted alphabetically on the Photo ID beforehand so our run time to update all the records is O(n) versus O(n<sup>2</sup>) where n is the number of records (photo entries). Then, we loop over all the records in the Google Sheets file to send the emails out. There is the email function template which takes all the input data from each row and formats it into an email. I also wrote a couple helper functions to add paragraph spaces between paragraphs and format the scoring table.
